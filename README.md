### Introduction
Swin Transformer (the name Swin stands for Shifted window) is initially described in arxiv, which capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. It is basically a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection.

Swin Transformer achieves strong performance on COCO object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on test-dev) and ADE20K semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on val), surpassing previous models by a large margin.<vr>
